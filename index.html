<div id="t2" class="m1">Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS

    [The heading means literally "The Nine Variations," but as Sun Tzŭ does
    not appear to enumerate these, and as, indeed, he has already told us
    (V §§ 6-11) that such deflections from the ordinary course are
    practically innumerable, we have little option but to follow Wang Hsi,
    who says that "Nine" stands for an indefinitely large number. "All it
    means is that in warfare we ought to vary our tactics to the utmost
    degree…. I do not know what Ts’ao Kung makes these Nine Variations out
    to be, but it has been suggested that they are connected with the Nine
    Situations" - of chapt. XI. This is the view adopted by Chang Yu. The
    only other alternative is to suppose that something has been lost—a
    supposition to which the unusual shortness of the chapter lends some
    weight.]
    
    
    1. Sun Tzŭ said: In war, the general receives his commands from the
    sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces.
    
    [Repeated from VII. § 1, where it is certainly more in place. It may
    have been interpolated here merely in order to supply a beginning to
    the chapter.]
    
    
    2. When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high
    roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in
    dangerously isolated positions.
    
    [The last situation is not one of the Nine Situations as given in the
    beginning of chap. XI, but occurs later on (ibid. § 43. q.v.). Chang Yu
    defines this situation as being situated across the frontier, in
    hostile territory. Li Ch’uan says it is "country in which there are no
    springs or wells, flocks or herds, vegetables or firewood;" Chia Lin,
    "one of gorges, chasms and precipices, without a road by which to
    advance."]
    
    
    In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In a desperate
    position, you must fight.
    
    3. There are roads which must not be followed,
    
    ["Especially those leading through narrow defiles," says Li Ch’uan,
    "where an ambush is to be feared."]
    
    
    armies which must be not attacked,
    
    [More correctly, perhaps, "there are times when an army must not be
    attacked." Ch’en Hao says: "When you see your way to obtain a rival
    advantage, but are powerless to inflict a real defeat, refrain from
    attacking, for fear of overtaxing your men’s strength."]
    
    
    towns which must not be besieged,
    
    [Cf. III. § 4 Ts’ao Kung gives an interesting illustration from his own
    experience. When invading the territory of Hsu-chou, he ignored the
    city of Hua-pi, which lay directly in his path, and pressed on into the
    heart of the country. This excellent strategy was rewarded by the
    subsequent capture of no fewer than fourteen important district cities.
    Chang Yu says: "No town should be attacked which, if taken, cannot be
    held, or if left alone, will not cause any trouble." Hsun Ying, when
    urged to attack Pi-yang, replied: "The city is small and
    well-fortified; even if I succeed intaking it, it will be no great feat
    of arms; whereas if I fail, I shall make myself a laughing-stock." In
    the seventeenth century, sieges still formed a large proportion of war.
    It was Turenne who directed attention to the importance of marches,
    countermarches and manœuvers. He said: "It is a great mistake to waste
    men in taking a town when the same expenditure of soldiers will gain a
    province." [1] ]
    
    
    positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which
    must not be obeyed.
    
    [This is a hard saying for the Chinese, with their reverence for
    authority, and Wei Liao Tzŭ (quoted by Tu Mu) is moved to exclaim:
    "Weapons are baleful instruments, strife is antagonistic to virtue, a
    military commander is the negation of civil order!" The unpalatable
    fact remains, however, that even Imperial wishes must be subordinated
    to military necessity.]
    
    
    4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany
    variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.
    
    5. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted
    with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn
    his knowledge to practical account.
    
    [Literally, "get the advantage of the ground," which means not only
    securing good positions, but availing oneself of natural advantages in
    every possible way. Chang Yu says: "Every kind of ground is
    characterized by certain natural features, and also gives scope for a
    certain variability of plan. How it is possible to turn these natural
    features to account unless topographical knowledge is supplemented by
    versatility of mind?"]
    
    
    6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying
    his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will
    fail to make the best use of his men.
    
    [Chia Lin tells us that these imply five obvious and generally
    advantageous lines of action, namely: "if a certain road is short, it
    must be followed; if an army is isolated, it must be attacked; if a
    town is in a parlous condition, it must be besieged; if a position can
    be stormed, it must be attempted; and if consistent with military
    operations, the ruler’s commands must be obeyed." But there are
    circumstances which sometimes forbid a general to use these advantages.
    For instance, "a certain road may be the shortest way for him, but if
    he knows that it abounds in natural obstacles, or that the enemy has
    laid an ambush on it, he will not follow that road. A hostile force may
    be open to attack, but if he knows that it is hard-pressed and likely
    to fight with desperation, he will refrain from striking," and so on.]
    
    
    7. Hence in the wise leader’s plans, considerations of advantage and of
    disadvantage will be blended together.
    
    ["Whether in an advantageous position or a disadvantageous one," says
    Ts’ao Kung, "the opposite state should be always present to your
    mind."]</div><div id="t4" class="m1">F1precipitation1<br>F2snow2<br>F3wind3

        </div><div class="m1">
    
    
    8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may
    succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.
    
    [Tu Mu says: "If we wish to wrest an advantage from the enemy, we must
    not fix our minds on that alone, but allow for the possibility of the
    enemy also doing some harm to us, and let this enter as a factor into
    our calculations."]
    
    
    9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always
    ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from
    misfortune.
    
    [Tu Mu says: "If I wish to extricate myself from a dangerous position,
    I must consider not only the enemy’s ability to injure me, but also my
    own ability to gain an advantage over the enemy. If in my counsels
    these two considerations are properly blended, I shall succeed in
    liberating myself…. For instance; if I am surrounded by the enemy and
    only think of effecting an escape, the nervelessness of my policy will
    incite my adversary to pursue and crush me; it would be far better to
    encourage my men to deliver a bold counter-attack, and use the
    advantage thus gained to free myself from the enemy’s toils." See the
    story of Ts’ao Ts’ao, VII. § 35, note.]
    
    
    10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them;
    
    [Chia Lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury, some of
    which would only occur to the Oriental mind:—"Entice away the enemy’s
    best and wisest men, so that he may be left without counselors.
    Introduce traitors into his country, that the government policy may be
    rendered futile. Foment intrigue and deceit, and thus sow dissension
    between the ruler and his ministers. By means of every artful
    contrivance, cause deterioration amongst his men and waste of his
    treasure. Corrupt his morals by insidious gifts leading him into
    excess. Disturb and unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely
    women." Chang Yu (after Wang Hsi) makes a different interpretation of
    Sun Tzŭ here: "Get the enemy into a position where he must suffer
    injury, and he will submit of his own accord."]
    
    
    and make trouble for them,
    
    [Tu Mu, in this phrase, in his interpretation indicates that trouble
    should be made for the enemy affecting their "possessions," or, as we
    might say, "assets," which he considers to be "a large army, a rich
    exchequer, harmony amongst the soldiers, punctual fulfillment of
    commands." These give us a whip-hand over the enemy.]
    
    
    and keep them constantly engaged;
    
    [Literally, "make servants of them." Tu Yu says "prevent them from
    having any rest."]
    
    
    hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.
    
    [Meng Shih’s note contains an excellent example of the idiomatic use
    of: "cause them to forget _pien_ (the reasons for acting otherwise than
    on their first impulse), and hasten in our direction."]
    
    
    11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the
    enemy’s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the
    chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made
    our position unassailable.
    
    12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1)
    Recklessness, which leads to destruction;
    
    ["Bravery without forethought," as Ts’ao Kung analyzes it, which causes
    a man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad bull. Such an
    opponent, says Chang Yu, "must not be encountered with brute force, but
    may be lured into an ambush and slain." Cf. Wu Tzŭ, chap. IV. ad init.:
    "In estimating the character of a general, men are wont to pay
    exclusive attention to his courage, forgetting that courage is only one
    out of many qualities which a general should possess. The merely brave
    man is prone to fight recklessly; and he who fights recklessly, without
    any perception of what is expedient, must be condemned." Ssu-ma Fa,
    too, makes the incisive remark: "Simply going to one’s death does not
    bring about victory."]
    
    
    (2) cowardice, which leads to capture;
    
    [Ts’ao Kung defines the Chinese word translated here as "cowardice" as
    being of the man "whom timidity prevents from advancing to seize an
    advantage," and Wang Hsi adds "who is quick to flee at the sight of
    danger." Meng Shih gives the closer paraphrase "he who is bent on
    returning alive," this is, the man who will never take a risk. But, as
    Sun Tzŭ knew, nothing is to be achieved in war unless you are willing
    to take risks. T’ai Kung said: "He who lets an advantage slip will
    subsequently bring upon himself real disaster." In 404 A.D., Liu Yu
    pursued the rebel Huan Hsuan up the Yangtsze and fought a naval battle
    with him at the island of Ch’eng-hung. The loyal troops numbered only a
    few thousands, while their opponents were in great force. But Huan
    Hsuan, fearing the fate which was in store for him should be be
    overcome, had a light boat made fast to the side of his war-junk, so
    that he might escape, if necessary, at a moment’s notice. The natural
    result was that the fighting spirit of his soldiers was utterly
    quenched, and when the loyalists made an attack from windward with
    fireships, all striving with the utmost ardor to be first in the fray,
    Huan Hsuan’s forces were routed, had to burn all their baggage and fled
    for two days and nights without stopping. Chang Yu tells a somewhat
    similar story of Chao Ying-ch’i, a general of the Chin State who during
    a battle with the army of Ch’u in 597 B.C. had a boat kept in readiness
    for him on the river, wishing in case of defeat to be the first to get
    across.]
    
    
    (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;
    
    [Tu Mu tells us that Yao Hsing, when opposed in 357 A.D. by Huang Mei,
    Teng Ch’iang and others shut himself up behind his walls and refused to
    fight. Teng Ch’iang said: "Our adversary is of a choleric temper and
    easily provoked; let us make constant sallies and break down his walls,
    then he will grow angry and come out. Once we can bring his force to
    battle, it is doomed to be our prey." This plan was acted upon, Yao
    Hsiang came out to fight, was lured as far as San-yuan by the enemy’s
    pretended flight, and finally attacked and slain.]
    
    
    (4) a delicacy of honour which is sensitive to shame;
    
    This need not be taken to mean that a sense of honour is really a defect
    in a general. What Sun Tzŭ condemns is rather an exaggerated
    sensitiveness to slanderous reports, the thin-skinned man who is stung
    by opprobrium, however undeserved. Mei Yao-ch’en truly observes, though
    somewhat paradoxically: "The seeker after glory should be careless of
    public opinion."]
    
    
    (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and
    trouble.
    
    [Here again, Sun Tzŭ does not mean that the general is to be careless
    of the welfare of his troops. All he wishes to emphasize is the danger
    of sacrificing any important military advantage to the immediate
    comfort of his men. This is a shortsighted policy, because in the long
    run the troops will suffer more from the defeat, or, at best, the
    prolongation of the war, which will be the consequence. A mistaken
    feeling of pity will often induce a general to relieve a beleaguered
    city, or to reinforce a hard-pressed detachment, contrary to his
    military instincts. It is now generally admitted that our repeated
    efforts to relieve Ladysmith in the South African War were so many
    strategical blunders which defeated their own purpose. And in the end,
    relief came through the very man who started out with the distinct
    resolve no longer to subordinate the interests of the whole to
    sentiment in favour of a part. An old soldier of one of our generals who
    failed most conspicuously in this war, tried once, I remember, to
    defend him to me on the ground that he was always "so good to his men."
    By this plea, had he but known it, he was only condemning him out of
    Sun Tzŭ’s mouth.]
    
    
    13. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the
    conduct of war.
    
    14. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will
    surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a
    subject of meditation.
